## About

We're a undergraduate student team from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. Some of our members are the first time experiencing game development. The game itself may not be very attractive. However, we've tried our best to perform this cute and tiny story to you.

Art and music resources are completely original! Tens of thousands of thanks to our art designer @Nanamaki

Theoretically our game supports Linux and macOS. However, it might require you to do some extra permission adjustment to run the game successfully. Basically you could try ```chmod +x``` and append the game path.

If you encounter any kind of bugs, feel free to let us know!

Wish all of you enjoy this tiny space journey.

## Changes
- Fixed some bugs to enhance game experience, including
  - Heroine cannot be displayed properly when gravity reversed
  - Background music only played once
  - Sometimes after-game plot cannot be displayed properly
  - My bro broke up with me because the **loud** bg deafened his ears. So we made volume adjustment back
  - Make SFX great again (?)
  - Modified some details of map
